This repository offers a python pandas solution in the education sector to analyze city's school district data. 
This project will help school board to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 


This project used two datasets in csv format, one is schools_complete.csv file wich includes; in columns Student ID,school_name,type,size,budget. The other dataset is students_complete.csv file which include; in columns Student ID,student_name,gender,grade,school_name,reading_scoreand math_score.

Conclusions from the data set:

The dataset shows a total of 15 schools, 39,170 students. The total students average reading score is 81.87 which is higher than the average math score 78.98. When we see the passing rate reading (85.80%) has a higher rate than math (74.98 % ),the overall passing rate is 65.17%. Thus indicating that student's score more in reading than math.
